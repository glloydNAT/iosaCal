 Installation
==============

The latest release of IOSACal is always available on PyPI.

To run IOSACal on your local system you will need to have Python_ installed.

.. note::

    If you're not comfortable using the terminal, you may prefer running IOSACal in your browser with MyBinder_ or :ref:`google_colab`.

.. _MyBinder: https://codeberg.org/steko/iosacal-mybinder

Python is available for almost any operating system, including Linux, Windows and MacOS. Python may be already installed on your system.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

Once you have installed Python or checked that it is already installed, IOSACal can be installed into a new virtual environment as follows::

    python -m venv iosacal_env
    ./iosacal_env/bin/activate
    python -m pip install iosacal

After the install has completed, the ``iosacal`` command will be available from the command line.
